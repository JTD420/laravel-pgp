## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've found a vulnerability in one of my projects, please let me know by reporting it at: [Report Vulnerability](https://github.com/JTD420/laravel-pgp/security/advisories/new). I will do my best to respond promptly and keep you updated on the status of your report.

If the vulnerability is accepted, I will work to quickly resolve the issue and release an updated version of the project. If the vulnerability is declined, I will provide an explanation for my decision.

I take security concerns very seriously, and I appreciate your help in making my projects safer for everyone.
